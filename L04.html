        # Lecture 04
        ## Using Pseudocode Statements and Flowchart Symbols
        
        ---
        
        # Introduction
        
        When a programmer plans the logic for a solution, they often use one of two tools: **pseudocode** (pronounced sue-doe-code) or **flowcharts**.
        
        ---
        
        # Pseudocode
        
        An English-like representation of the logical steps it takes to solve a problem.
        
        *Pseudo* means *false*, and *code* means....well....*code*
        
        ---
        
        # Flowchart
        
        A pictorial representation of the (potential) program logic.

        # Writing Pseudocode

        Using pseudocode involves writing down all the steps you will use in a program.

        Prefancing pseudocode can be done with statements like **start** and **stop**
        
        ```
        start
            input myNumber
            set myAnswer = myNumber * 2
            output myAnswer
        stop
        ```

        ---
        
        # Writing pseudocode
        
        Pseudocode is fairly flexible because it is a planning tool, and not the final product.

        - Instead of `start` and `stop`, some pseudocode developers would use other terms such as `begin` and `end`.
        - Instead of writing `input myNumber`, some developers would write `get myNumber` or `read myNumber`.
        - Instead of writing `set myAnswer = myNumber * 2`, some developers would write calculate `myAnswer = myNumber times 2` or `compute myAnswer as myNumber doubled`.
        - Instead of writing `output myAnswer`, many pseudocode developers would write `display myAnswer`, `print myAnswer`, or `write myAnswer`.
        
        ---
        
        # Moving that logic over
        
        When you eventually convert your pseudocode to a specific programming language,
        you do not have such flexibility because specific syntax will be required.

        ```
        class Program { 
            static void Main(string[] args) 
            {           
                int x = Console.Read(); 
                x *= 2;
                Console.WriteLine(x); 
            } 
        } 
        ```

        # Drawing flowcharts
        
        Some programmers prefer drawing flowcharts to represent the logical
        flow, because flowcharts allow programmers to visualize more easily how the program statements will connect.

        You can draw a flowchart by hand or use software
        
        ---
        
        # Input symbol
        
        You use a parallelogram to represent an input symbol, which indicates an input operation.
        You write an input statement in English inside the parallelogram.

        # Processing symbol
        
        Arithmetic operation statements are examples of processing.
        In a flowchart, you use a rectangle as the processing symbol that contains a processing statement.

        ---
        
        # Output symbol
        
        Because the parallelogram is used for both input and output, it is often called the **input/output symbol or I/O symbol**.

        ---
        
        # Flowlines
        
        To show the correct sequence of these statements, you use arrows, or flowlines, to connect the steps.

        # Terminal symbols
        
        Start/ stop symbols, at each end.

        # Repeating instructions

        If a problem has x amount of repeating steps, we can loop it fairly simply.
