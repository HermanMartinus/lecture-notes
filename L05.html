        # Lecture 05
        ## How to write a pseudocode
        
        ---
        
        # Introduction
        
        Pseudo code is a term which is often used in programming and algorithm based fields.

        It is a methodology that allows the programmer to represent the implementation of an algorithm.
        
        ---
        
        # Pseudocode
        
        Can be interpreted by programmers no matter what their programming background or knowledge is.

        Pseudo code: It’s simply an implementation of an algorithm in the form of annotations and informative
        text written in plain English.
        
        It has no syntax like any of the programming language and thus can’t be compiled or interpreted by the computer.
        
        ---
        
        # Advantages of pseudocode
        
        - Improves the readability of any approach.
        - Works as a rough documentation, so the program of one developer can be understood by another.
        - Explain what exactly each line of a program should do.
        ---
        
        # How to write pseudocode

        1 - Arrange the sequence of tasks and write the pseudocode accordingly.
        2 - Start with the statement of a pseudo code which establishes the main goal or the aim.
        Example:
        ```
        This program will allow the user to check
        the number whether it's even or odd.
        ```

        ---
        
        # How to write pseudocode
        
        3 - The way the if-else, for, while loops are indented in a program, indent the statements likewise, as it helps to comprehend the decision control and execution mechanism. They also improve the readability to a great extent.
        Example:
        ```
        if "1"
            print response
                "I am case 1"
        
        if "2"
            print response
                "I am case 2"
        ```

        ---
        
        # How to write pseudocode
        
        4 - Use appropriate naming conventions. The naming must be simple and distinct.
        
        5 - Use appropriate sentence casings, such as CamelCase for methods, upper case for constants and lower case for variables (or something).

        ```
        class Program { 
            static void Main(string[] args) 
            {           
                int x = Console.Read(); 
                x *= 2;
                Console.WriteLine(x); 
            } 
        } 
        ```

        ---
        
        # How to write pseudocode
        
        6 - Elaborate everything which is going to happen in the actual code. Don’t make the pseudo code abstract.
        
        7 - Use standard programming structures such as ‘if-then’, ‘for’, ‘while’, ‘cases’ the way we use it in programming.
        
        ---
        
        # How to write pseudocode
        
        8 - Check whether all the sections of a pseudo code is complete, finite and clear to understand and comprehend.
        
        9 - Don’t write the pseudo code in a complete programmatic manner. It is necessary to be simple to understand even for a layman or client, hence don’t incorporate too many technical terms.

        # Example
        
        ```
        import java.util.*; 
  
        public class LowestCommonMultiple { 
        
            private static long
            lcmNaive(long numberOne, long numberTwo) 
            { 
        
                long lowestCommonMultiple; 
        
                lowestCommonMultiple = (numberOne * numberTwo) 
                    / greatestCommonDivisor(numberOne, numberTwo); 
        
                return lowestCommonMultiple; 
            } 
        
            private static long greatestCommonDivisor(long numberOne, long numberTwo) 
            { 
        
                if (numberTwo == 0) 
                    return numberOne; 
        
                return greatestCommonDivisor(numberTwo, numberOne % numberTwo); 
            } 
        } 
        ```
        
        ---
        
        # Example
        ```
        This program calculates the Lowest Common multiple  
        for excessively long input values 
        
        function lcmNaive(Argument one, Argument two){ 
        
            Calculate the lowest common variable of Argument 
            1 and Argument 2 by dividing their product by their 
            Greatest common divisor product 
        
            return lowest common multiple 
        end 
        } 
        function greatestCommonDivisor(Argument one, Argument two){ 
            if Argument two is equal to zero 
                then return Argument one 
        
            return the greatest common divisor 
        
        end 
        } 
        ```
