# Lecture 01
## Computer systems & programming

---

# Introduction

A **computer system** is a combination of all the components required to process and store data using a computer.

Every computer system is composed of multiple pieces of hardware and software.

---

# Hardware

## Physical devices associated with the computer.

- Keyboards, mice, speakers
- Embedded systems
- Mainframes

Computer hardware needs instructions that control how and when data items are input,
how they are processed, and the form in which they are output or stored.

---

# Software

## Instructions which tell the computer what to do. 

**Programs:** Instruction sets written by programmers 

When you write software instructions, you are **programming.**

---

# The 2 kinds of software

## Application software

Also shorthandedly known as an **app** and is all the programs you apply to a task,
such as word- processing programs, spreadsheets, payroll and inventory programs, and games.

---

# The 2 kinds of software

## System software

Comprises the programs that you use to manage your computer, including operating systems.
- **Operating systems** - Windows, Linux, OSX, iOS, Android
- **Device Drivers** - Controls particular hardware which is attached to the system.
- **Firmware** - Permanent software that is embedded into a read-only memory (eg: BIOS)
- **Programming Language Translators** - Mediator programs on which software programs rely to translate high-level language code to simpler machine-level code.
- **Utility** - Aid in analyzing, optimizing, configuring and maintaining a computer system

---

# The 2 kinds of software

These are fairly useless definitions.

---

# The 3 major operations of computer systems

#### Input
Data items enter the computer system and are placed in memory.

#### Processing
Handling the data in order to make it meaningful.

#### Output
Display or use the meaningful, processed information.
- Could also just be stored for potential later use.

---

# Programming languages

Computer instructions are written in a computer **programming language**.
- Java
- Python
- C++
- Erlang
- Haskell

Some programmers work exclusively in one language, whereas others know several and use the one that is best suited to the task at hand.

---

# Code

Instructions written in a programming language are called **program code** or just **code**.

## Syntax

Each language has a unique syntax governing work use and punctuation.

Mistakes are called **syntax errors**

## Computers are dumb...real dumb

---

# Levels of programming languages

Low-level programming is close to machine code, high-level programming is closer to natural languages.

## Low level
```
LUI  R1, #1

LUI  R2, #2

DADD R3, R1, R2
```
## High level
```
x = 1 + 2;
```

---

# Some syntax/level examples

### In C:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

### In BASIC:
```
10 PRINT "Hello world!"
20 END
```

---

# Some syntax/level examples

### In Java:
```
public class HelloWorld
{
  public static void main(string[] args)
  {
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
  }
} 
```

### In Pascal:
```
program HelloWorld;

begin
  writeln('Hello World');
end.
```

---

# Some syntax/level examples

### In Perl:
```
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Hello World!\n";
```
### In Python:
```
print("Hello World!")
```

# How does the magic happen? 

## Code is stored in memory
- Random access memory, or RAM, is a form of internal, volatile memory.
- Internal storage is **volatile**—its contents are lost when the computer is turned off or loses power.
- Permanent storage devices are **nonvolatile**—that is, their contents are persistent and are retained even when power is lost.

---

# How does the magic happen? 

## Code is translated to machine language
**Machine language** represents the millions of on/off circuits within the computer.
Programming language statements are called **source code**, and the translated machine language statements are **object code**.

Each programming language uses a piece of software, called a compiler or an interpreter,
to translate your source code into **machine language** or **binary**.

Represented in 1s and 0s.

---

# How does the magic happen?

## The computer can then carry out the program instructions

When instructions are carried out, a program **runs**, or **executes**.

# Compiler vs Interpreter

A **compiled program** has to be modified into machine code before it is used.
- As an analogy, think of a novel that was written in one language and then translated into another.

An **interpreted program** is stored in a human-readable form.
- This is analogous to the role that a human interpreter performs. 

### As a generalization, compiled programs are faster to run but slower to develop.

---

# Basic goals of computer programming
### When you are planning to create a computer program you should:

- Ensure your program fulfills the need it is addressing.
- Ensure that people can easily use your program.
- Ensure that it is easy to understand, fix, and improve your program without a major time investment.
- Enhance problem solving using logic.
- Developing a high understanding of principles in programming.
- Demonstrating basic concepts, and software applications.
- Recognizing ethical working codes.

---

# How does one become a programmer?

A programmer is generally tasked with producing a solution to a problem via a computer program.

The programmer therefore must be able to **understand the problem**, **derive an appropriate solution**,
and then be able to **effectively express that solution** in a computer programming language.

- Learn to work with others in a team environment.
- Agile/Continuous development

### Don't be afraid to make mistakes because you will make them—*constantly* and for the rest of your career.

---

# Common problems
### These are very common mistakes programmers make:

- Your program does not do a job any better than an available alternative program. At best, you're re-inventing the wheel.
- Your program does not work as intended.
- Your program is too complicated or too primitive to be useful to most people.
- Other people, or yourself at a later time, can't understand the programming behind your program. This means your project won't grow.

---

# Setting up java

Download and install java JDK

Get an IDE 
- notepad++
- VSC
- VIM (for the hardcore)

Play around with using **bash** or the **terminal**
