        # Introduction
        
        A programmer doesn't just sit down and start writing code.
        
        There's more to it than that.

        # Understanding the Problem
        
        Programmers write programs to satisfy the needs of others, called **users** or **end users**.
        
        Programmers are providing a service to these users, programmers must first understand what the users want.
        
        When a program runs, you usually think of the logic as a cycle of **input-processing-output** operations,
        
        but when you plan a program, you think of the **output first**.

        # The importance of a spec document
        
        Documentation consists of all the supporting paperwork for a program; it might include items such as original requests for the program from users, sample output, and descriptions of the data items available for input.
        
        Depending on the project, spec documents will vary.

        # Planning the Logic
        
        The heart of the programming process lies in planning the program’s logic. During this phase of the process, the programmer plans the steps of the program, deciding what steps to include and how to order them. You can plan the solution to a problem in many ways.
        
        The two most common planning tools are **flowcharts** and **pseudocode**.
        
        You may hear programmers refer to planning a program as **“developing an algorithm.”** An algorithm is the sequence of steps or rules you follow to solve a problem.

        # Coding the Program
        
        Some experienced programmers can successfully combine logic planning and program coding in one step.
        
        This may work for planning and writing a very simple program, just as you can plan and write a postcard to a friend using one step.
        
        A good term paper or a Hollywood screenplay, however, needs planning before writing—and so do most programs.

        # Translate the Program into Machine Language
        
        Interpreted vs Compiled languages
        
        Source code vs Object code
        
        When writing a program, a programmer **will** need to recompile the code several times.

        # Testing the Program
        
        A program that is free of syntax errors is not necessarily free of logical errors.
        
        Once a program is free of syntax errors, the programmer can test it—that is, execute it with some sample data to see whether the results are logically correct.
        
        The process of finding and correcting program errors is called **debugging**. You debug a program by testing it using many sets of data.

        # Putting the Program into Production
        
        Once the program is thoroughly tested and debugged, it is ready for the organization to use.
        
        Production deploys differ depending on the type of program.

        # Maintaining the Program
        
        Maintenance can be required for many reasons. All programs need maintenance.
        
        It's why the world is moving to subscription based services.
